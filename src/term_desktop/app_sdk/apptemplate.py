# ? This function is used by the app loader to load the app.

# Note that it's very important to the architecture of the app that this
# loader returns a class definition and not an instance.
# We don't want every app to be booted up along with the desktop environment!
# Term-Desktop only initializes the class on demand when it needs to.
